## Overview

Fault Proof System V2 has been designed to address the key limitations identified in
[Fault Proof System V1](../../fault-proof/challenge.md), as outlined in the [Background](./overview.md#background). This
document details how each of the four main limitations of V1 has been effectively resolved in V2.

## Guaranteed Win of Valid Output

In V2, the [output branching model](./output-proposal.md#output-branching-model) has been introduced. This model allows
[validators][g-validator] to follow and propose [outputs][g-checkpoint-output] along the branch they believe to be
correct, thereby eliminating the need to delete outputs deemed invalid as a result of a challenge. This directly
addresses a critical V1 issue where a challenger could always win if the previous output was deleted, as it was
impossible to verify the last point of agreement between the asserter and challenger on-chain. Now, the previous output
remains intact, and validators can branch out from the first output they dispute.

Also, in V2, challenge creation and dissection are based on [historical commitments](./definitions.md#claim) of outputs,
unlike V1, which was based on individual outputs. This change allows any validators who concur with the entire
[history](./definitions.md#history) to participate in an ongoing challenge, ensuring that they don't lose due to
timeouts.

## Guaranteed Data Verifiability for ZK Proof Verification

[Transaction Data Commitment](./transaction-data-commitment.md) in V2 ensures that the transaction data required for ZK
proof verification is verifiable on-chain. Validators can now conclusively prove on-chain that they have executed the
correct transactions in the target block to compute the state transition and claimed the correct post-state.

## Robust to Delay Attacks

In V1, delay attacks were possible through successive malicious challenges and deletions of outputs in the case where a
previous output was deleted. V2's output branching model solves this effectively.

## Accurate Identification of First Disagreeing Block

Because [transaction data is verifiable on-chain](./transaction-data-commitment.md), the
[version 1 output root payload](./output-proposal.md#output-root-payload-version-1) no longer relies on the information
from the next block, which leads to the elimination of `next_block_hash` from [output root][g-l2-output] payload. This
allows accurate identification of the first disagreeing block after dissection.
